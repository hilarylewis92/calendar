# Calendar

```
git clone https://github.com/hilarylewis92/calendar.git
npm install 
npm start 
visit http://localhost:3000/ in browser
```

* Add an event title, location, start, and end time in the input fields
* If not all input fields are filled in, the submit button is disabled
* Upon creating an event, take a look at the calendar and see if the event is in the correct location
* Try adding two different events with times that overlap, see what happens! 

#### If more time allowed: 
- [ ] Fix noon and midnight time algorithm 
- [ ] Add feedback to user if submit button is disabled
- [ ] Put form into a modal to make UX more enjoyable
